# FavoriteEmojis
An iOS 10 jailbreak tweak that replaces the "Frequently Used" section on the emoji keyboard with a favorites list

This is my first ever iOS jailbreak tweak written using theos (logos) and objective-c to hook and override some of Apple's methods in iOS. The tweak creates a settings panel where the user types in their desired emojis (input is saved to a .plist prefrence file), and then the tweak reads this data and overrides the emojis located in the "Frequently Used" section with the newly specified ones.
